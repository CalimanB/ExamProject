# Laravel - is the library of choice for executing my exam project.
I chose it due to several reasons:
* well established library that withstood the test of time;
* offers quick support for user registration and users handling via Laravel Breeze;
* I get the chance to exercise and expand my skill set at the same time.

#Skills gained or significantly improved while working on this project
* I learned how to install programs and features using the command prompt;
* I installed WSL and docker;
* I learned Markdown for writing coherent ands complete program documentations;
* I had my first interactions with Tailwind CSS.
